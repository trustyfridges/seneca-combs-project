description: "$1. Incomplete comb. Its handle is carved and represents the stylized
  busts of three human beings. Their head and torso are triangular in shape. It had
  more than 14 teeth that form 40% of its height. He was found in the grave of a child
  of about three years old behind his head. This comb comes from the seneca Dutch
  flollow site dating from 1605-1620 AD. It is very similar to the neutral comb #255
  which is almost a century older. (RMSC AR 27750). (Ritchie 1954: 25"
