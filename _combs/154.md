description: '74. Almost complete comb some teeth are broken. On his handle we find
  the theme of the "colossus": a human character in the center seeming to fight with
  two animals indeterminate but larger than him on each side. The eyes and mouth of
  the central character are formed by punctuations. Many incised lines are found on
  the character and base; on animals are spiritual lines that go from the heart to
  the mouth. It has 16 teeth that account for 22% of its total length. It is 13 cm
  long and 5.8 cm wide. It comes from the seneca village Boughton Hill dating from
  1670-1687 AD. J.-C. (RMSC 6309/103). (Kroup et al. 1986: 34'
