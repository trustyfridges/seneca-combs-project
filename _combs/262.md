  back to back. On one of the bears we see engraved a vertical hourglass pattern with
  two horizontal branches on each side as well as two hourglasses inside circles.
  The negative space between the front and back legs of the two bears also forms a
  horizontal hourglass pattern. "Spiritual lines" also pass from the heart to the
  mouth. Its teeth form 36% of the total length of the comb. It is of Seneca origin
  and dates from about 1681 AD.C. (Realn ofthe troquois p. 104)
