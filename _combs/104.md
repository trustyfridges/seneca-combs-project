description: 305. Incomplete comb. The handle is carved with two mammiferes facing
  each other joined by the front legs. The eyes are recreated with the help of punctuations
  and we see these punctuations on the belly of the animal on the right. The mouths
  are incised and perhaps "spiritual lines" are present. The base of the comb is incised
  with horizontal lines and semicircles. It is about 5.7 cm long and 3.9 cm wide.
  Its 17 teeth form 56% of the total length of the comb. It comes from the Dann site
  a Seneca site dating from 1655-1675 AD. J.-C. (RMSC 1060-$2
