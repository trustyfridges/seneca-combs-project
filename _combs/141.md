description: Bone comb almost complete (two broken teeth) having had 1$ teeth that
  form 44% of its total length. tI is 12.4 cm long by 7.5 cm wide. The carved handle
  depicts four animals in "double mirror". The two animals in the center are back
  to back and the other two outside face those in the center. On central animals there
  are two punctuations in the center of the abdomen and many horizontal incised lines
  as well as a line that follows the curve of the back. Incised lines are also found
  on the base of the handle. Negative spaces between animals form 3 vertical hourglasses.
  One can see on the teeth the lines that have been drawn to guide the craftsman in
  his work. This is a seneca comb from the site Boughton Hill 1670-1687 AD. J.-C.
