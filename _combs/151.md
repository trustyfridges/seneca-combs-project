description: '70. Comb almost complete but very damaged having 17 teeth that form
  35% of its total length. It is 8.6 cm long by 4.9 cm wide. The carved handle represents
  two otters (mirror) whose muzzle touches. The base of the handle also carved seems
  to represent two birds touching each other by the beak (mirror). Below it are seen
  triangular and horizontal incised lines. This comb comes from Boughton Hill a Seneca
  site from 1670-J 687 AD (RMSC 22 1/103). (Kroup et al. $196: 32'
